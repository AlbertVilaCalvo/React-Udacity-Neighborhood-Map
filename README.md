# Welcome to the Catalonia Locations app!

## How to try the production app

`npm install` or `yarn install`

`npm start` or `yarn start`

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

`npm install -g serve` or `yarn global add serve`

`serve -s build`

## How to try the development app

`npm install` or `yarn install`

`npm start` or `yarn start`

This runs the app in development mode.

You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Wikipedia API

This app uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve information about the displayed locations.

# Screenshots

*Initially all the locations are shown*

<img src='screenshots/screenshot-1.png' width='640px' style="margin-right: 40px;">

*Clicking on a location on the list focuses the map on that location's marker and displays information about it from the Wikipedia API*

*You can also filter the list of locations with the search field*
